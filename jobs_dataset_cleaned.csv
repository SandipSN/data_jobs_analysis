Data Scientist,Permanent,72000.0,London,Cititec Talent Limited,JS-RF/03/05/22,"The Data Science market in the United Kingdom is very buoyant at the moment and companies across all sectors are looking to expand their data teams and my publishing technology Client is no different in that respect. What does set them above other companies similar to their size though is that, despite being a large corporate, you won't be bogged down in Legacy and BAU typed work. This is a greenfield project you'll be getting your teeth stuck into.So what will you be doing here as a Data Scientist? Well, you'll get the chance to build out their new data platform from scratch. What is this data platform for? Well, it's an analytics platform used to develop loyalty schemes for their Clients.But it is not just building the data platform that makes this role pretty neat. It's also the environment too. Yes it is a large company but the feel of this team and project will feel like that of a start-up; a fast-paced environment, building a new platform within an autonomous and greenfield environment. Many data professionals I come across want to work in start-ups but worry about things such as funding. With this organisation you won't have to worry about that.What will you need to have? They'd like you to have around 4 years of experience, ideally in a data scientist role but if not a data scientist role, a data-centric role would do with strong Alteryx SQL and Python skills. Experience working on large and complex data sets would be crucial too. From a personal perspective, they would like you to be confident when dealing with various groups of stakeholders in the business but also outside the business as well.If you want to work with a diverse team of professionals in a really cool publishing technology company then please apply.
